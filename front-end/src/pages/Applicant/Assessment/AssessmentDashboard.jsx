                  <strong>Prepare Adequately:</strong> Spend some time preparing
                  for the assessment. Review the soft skills being assessed and
                  think about examples from your past experiences that

                  <strong>Demonstrate Soft Skills:</strong> During the
                  assessment, aim to demonstrate the soft skills being
                  evaluated. Show examples of your communication,
                  problem-solving, teamwork, and adaptability skills.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Use Time Wisely:</strong> Manage your time effectively
                  during each assessment. Allocate time for reading

                  <strong>Ignore Feedback:</strong> If feedback is provided on
                  your assessments, take it seriously and use it as an
                  opportunity for growth and improvement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lose Confidence:</strong> Even if you encounter
