# Artisan-Peeper (Front-End)

Assuming you are on the `Artisan-Peeper/front-end` directory

First thing you need to do is to run the code `npm run dev` on your Terminal.

The React application will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage
Second thing you need to do, is to create a new tab on your terminal and run the code below `npm run server`.

Once both the JSON server and React application are running, you can visit `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser to access the React application. The React application can make requests to the JSON server API endpoints to fetch or manipulate data.

## JSON Server

The JSON server is configured to serve data from `db.json` file. You can edit this file to add, remove, or modify data as needed for your application.

For more information about JSON server, refer to [JSON Server Documentation](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
